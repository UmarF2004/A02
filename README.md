PART 1:
**Directions on Using:**

Github with VS Code:

<ol>
Create an account on Github: you can use this link to do so https://github.com/signup?source=header-home 
<br> 
Install Git on your computer: you can use this link to do so https://git-scm.com/downloads 
<br>
Open VS Code
<br>
Search for Extension: You can do so by clicking Cntrl+Shift+X and searching for Github (for me it wasn't loading yet)
<br>
When Github extension installed, sign in to your account
<br>
Once signed in, you can **clone** repositories from GitHub by clicking on the "Clone Repository" button in the GitHub pane
<br>
You can open a repsitory in VS Code by selecting "Open Repository" in the GitHub pane 
<br>
You can now start using Github with VS Code
</ol>


  Github:

  **GitHub** is a **remote** reference to **GIT**, a software that allows multiple users to work on the same file and allows team members to view changes made by others in real time. 
<ol> 
<li>Once you have signed up to Github, you can create a **repository**. It is more like a folder where you can add files and make them live web pages that can be pulled up online using     URLs.</li>
<br>
<li>You can **push** files in the repository by clicking the 'add file' button in the repository. You can either create a new file or push an exisiting file from your device.</li> 
<br>
<li>After changing, modifying or adding content to your file, before exiting, you must **commit** changes using the 'commit changes' button. Changes not *committed* will be lost</li>
<br>
<li>After you have created and saved files in your repository, you can **pull, fetch, and merge** files.</li> 
<br>
</ol>   
However, if you are working with other team members, you must be aware of **merge conflicts**. If a conflict arises, Git will mark it as a conflicted file and you and your team         memebrs must resolve the conflict yourselves. 
  

    




Part 2: **Glossary**:
 **Branch** allows you to work on different features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. 
  <br><br>
  **Clone** copy of a target repository
  <br><br>
  **Commit** a command or button to save changes to a file. Changes that are not 'committed' or saved will be lost. 
<br><br>
  **Fetch**:  downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local device. It is used to see what changes other team members have made.
 <br><br>
  **GIT** Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in files and coordinating work on software projects. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a             project efficiently by managing changes, branches, and merges
  <br><br>
  **Github**: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It allows you projects to be live and available to open up on the web.
  <br><br>
  **Merge**  combineining the changes from one branch into another. It integrates the changes made in the source branch into the target branch.
  <br><br>
  **Merge Conflict** Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file, or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it. In                       these cases, Git cannot automatically determine what is correct. Conflicts only affect the developer conducting the merge, the rest of the team is unaware of the                         conflict. Git will mark the file as being conflicted and halt the merging process.
  <br><br>
  **Push**:  a command used to upload files to an online repository. It simply means to push files in.
  <br><br>
  **Pull** a command used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
  <br><br>
  **Remote** a reference to a repository hosted on a server, such as GitHub
  <br><br>
  **Repository** : A repository in Github is a collection of files and folders, along with the version history of those files.
